Lore:
You are but a lowly adventurer, stuck in this dungeon by a powerful force. You must prove yourself capable of escaping. 
However, you have a long history of failure, hence the "lowly" title. This power has taken pity on you and has made 
the dungeon incredibly easy. Good luck, Hopefully you won't need it!
